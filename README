Summary:
--------
OpenTREP aims at providing a clean API, and the corresponding C++
implementation, for parsing travel-focused requests (e.g.,
"washington dc beijing monday a/r +aa -ua 1 week 2 adults 1 dog").

OpenTREP uses Xapian (http://www.xapian.org) for the Information Retrieval part,
on freely available travel-related data (e.g., country names and codes,
city names and codes, airline names and codes, etc.).

OpenTREP exposes a simple, clean and object-oriented, API. For instance,
the static Parse() method takes, as input, a string containing the travel
request, and yields, as output, the list of the recognised terms as well as
their corresponding types. As an example, the travel request
"washington dc beijing monday a/r +aa -ua 1 week 2 adults 1 dog" would give
the following list:
  * Origin airport: Washington, DC, USA
  * Destination airport: Beijing, China
  * Date of travel: next Monday
  * Date of return: 1 week after next Monday
  * Preferred airline: American Airlines; non-preferred airline: United Airlines
  * Number of travellers: 2 adults and a dog

The output can then be used by other systems, for instance to book the
corresponding travel or to visualise it on a map and calendar and to
share it with others.

OpenTREP makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for
increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the
Boost (C++ Standard Extensions: http://www.boost.org) library is used.


Getting and installing from the Fedora/CentOS/RedHat distribution:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Just use Yum:
yum -y install opentrep-devel opentrep-doc

You can also get the RPM packages (which may work on Linux
distributions like Novel Suse and Mandriva) from the Fedora repository
(e.g., for Fedora 16, 
http://fr2.rpmfind.net/linux/fedora/releases/16/Everything/)


Building the library and test binary from Git repository:
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Sourceforge Git repository may be cloned as following:
git clone ssh://opentrep.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/opentrep/opentrep opentrepgit
cd opentrepgit
git checkout trunk

Then, you need the following packages (Fedora/RedHat/CentOS names here, 
but names may vary according to distributions):
  * cmake
  * gcc-c++
  * boost-devel
  * readline-devel
  * soci-mysql-devel
  * python-devel
  * gettext-devel
  * doxygen
  * tetex-latex (optional)
  * rpm-build (optional)

Building the library and test binary from the tarball:
------------------------------------------------------
The latest stable source tarball (opentrep*.tar.gz or .bz2) can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=252803

Then, as usual:
* To configure the project, type something like:
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/user/dev/deliveries/opentrep-0.4.2 \
   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug -DINSTALL_DOC:BOOL=ON ..
  cd /home/user/dev/deliveries
  rm -f opentrep-stable && ln -s opentrep-0.4.2 opentrep-stable
  cd -
* To build the project, type:
  make
* To test the project, type:
  make check
* To install the library (libopentrep*.so*) and the binary (opentrep), just type:
  make install
* To package the source files, type:
  make dist
* To package the binary and the documentation:
  make package
* To run the local binary version:
  ./opentrep/opentrep -b
* To run the installed version (the first following line must be done once
  per session):
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/user/dev/deliveries/opentrep-stable/lib
  /home/user/dev/deliveries/opentrep-stable/bin/opentrep -b
